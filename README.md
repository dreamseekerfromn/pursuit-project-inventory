# Pursuit Inventory Project

## Object
A mocking webpage for game inventory management which is created during Pursuit Module 2.

## Details About This Project
This project is just mock page so currently, it does not contain any database (no MongoDB, jquery, sql and etc).
This project was built w/ pure javascript, HTML5 w/ DOM manipulation.
Since it is just a mock page, an item accepts only 5 fields; name, price, description, image url, platform, and description.

## Stretch Goal That Was Made in This Project
A simple transition effect is added to the table row. When hovering the mouse to a table, the indicated item row will show some hidden properties w/ 0.5 sec transition effect.
Also, a user typed negative values for price & stock, it will automatically change to 0.

## ToDo
The first goal must be adopting db to make this project actual funtional inventory page.
The second goal is adding more events to change the values directly by clicking the data.
